The C Book - Disclaimer and Copyright Notice

The first edition of this book was based on a late draft of the ANSI standard for C and is copyright Mike Banahan. 
This online version is a reproduction of the second edition based on the published ANSI standard. 
The second edition was published in 1991, copyright Mike Banahan, Declan Brady and Mark Doran. 
By agreement with Declan Brady and Mark Doran, copyright in this online version and derived works is copyright Mike Banahan, 2003. 
The print versions were published by Addison Wesley.

This online version is derived from files in Unix nroff format 
discovered on a floppy disk just prior to a move of offices by GBdirect Ltd. 
It is believed that the files were used by the publishers Addison Wesley in the preparation of the second print edition 
and that some amendments or corrections may have been made in the print version that are not reflected in this online version. 
The online version was prepared with the assistance of some Perl scripts written by Mike Banahan, by Steve King, 
who cleaned up the output of the Perl scripts and also by sterling work by Geoff Richards and Aaron Crane 
who performed magic with XSLT to produce the HTML documents.

The publication of the online version is for historical interest 
and readers are warned that it should be treated as an historical document. 
There is now a later standard for the C programming language and this publication cannot be considered current: 
whilst for the most part the current and the first standard are very close, 
some substantive changes and extensions have occurred since 1991.
